### File: `# Mini-cours Python (d√©butant d√©butant) ‚Äî Terminal üñ•Ô∏è.md`

- Start with this file as it introduces Python in the terminal, focusing on basic concepts like `print`, variables, `input`, conditions, and loops.
- Includes a simple mini-project (guessing game) to reinforce learning.

### File: `Fiche m√©mo Python (d√©butant).md`

- Use this as a quick reference or recap after the first lesson. It summarizes the basics in a concise format.

## 2. Expanding Core Concepts

### File: `Partie 2.md`

- Introduce lists, functions, string manipulations, and error handling. These are foundational concepts that will be used in all future projects.
- Includes small exercises to practice these topics.

### File: `Gros cours complet.md`

- This file provides a comprehensive overview of Python basics, including variables, operators, conditions, loops, and user interaction.
- Use this as a structured follow-up to reinforce and expand on the basics.

## 3. Introduction to Visual Programming

### File: `# Cours d‚Äôintroduction au d√©veloppement .md`

- Introduce the concept of virtual environments (`venv`) and libraries like `turtle` for simple visual programming.
- Teach students how to draw shapes and create visual patterns, which adds a creative and engaging element to their learning.

## 4. Game Development with Pygame

### File: `# Mini-cours Python (d√©butant) ‚Äî Dessine.md`

- Start with this file to introduce `pygame` and teach students how to create a window, draw pixels, and animate simple objects.
- Focus on the basics of game loops and event handling.

### File: `# Cours Python ¬´ version fun ¬ª ‚Äî Pygame .md`
